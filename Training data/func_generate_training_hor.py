    ''' Generates the training data required for a supervised machine learning algorithm, making use of the Finegrid and Coarsegrid objects defined in grid_objects_training.py. NOTE: the script  does not yet extract individual samples out of the flow fields; this is done in sample_training_data_tfrecord.py. \\ 
    For each available time step in the MicroHH output, the steps in this script are as follows: 
        1) Read the wind velocity variables and the pressure from the output files produced by MicroHH in the specified input_directory (which should be a string).
        In this procedure, the wind velocities are normalized using a reference friction velocity that is calculated from the specified friction Reynolds number (via the variable reynolds_number_tau, which should be an integer or float). This should ensure that the training data is conistent for flows with similar Reynolds numbers.\\
        2) Downsample these variables to a user-defined coarse grid, which has a vertical resolution identical to the fine grid. \\ 
        The horizontal dimensions of this new grid are defined via the dim_new_grid variable, which should be a tuple existing of three integers each specifying the amount of grid cells in the y,x-directions respectively. \\ 
        The script implicitly assumes that the grid distances are uniform in all three directions, and that the sizes of the domain are the same as in the original grid produced by MicroHH. \\
        3) Interpolate the wind velocities on the fine grid to the grid boundaries of the coarse grid. \\
        4) Use the interpolated wind velocities calculated in step 3 to calculate all nine total turbulent transport components by integrating them over the corresponding grid boundaries. This includes calculating weights (or to be precise, fractions) that compensate for the relative contributions to the total integral. \\
        5) Interpolate the wind velocities on the coarse grid cells to the grid boundaries of the coarse grid. \\
        6) Calculate all nine resolved turbulent transport components by multiplying the corresponding interpolated wind velocities calculated in step 5, and calculate all nine unresolved turbulent transport components by taking the difference between the total and resolved turbulent transport components. \\
        7) Store all variables in a netCDF-file with user-specified name (the variable name_output_file, which should be a string) in user-specified output directory (via the variable output_directory, which should be a string), which serves as input for the script sample_training_data_tfrecord.py. \\
        
        NOTE: In the steps above the script implicitly assumes that the variables are located on a staggered Arakawa C-grid, where the variables located on the grid edges are always upstream/down of the corresponding grid centers (as is the case in MicroHH). \\

   The input variables for this script are: \\
        -dim_new_grid: a tuple existing of three integers, which specifies for each horizontal coordinate directions (y,x) the amount of grid cells in the user-defined coarse grid. \\
        -input_directory: a string specifying where the MicroHH output binary files are stored. \\
        -output_directory: a string specifying where the created netCDF-file should be stored. \\
        -reynolds_number_tau: an integer or float specifying a reference friction Reynolds number for the flow being considered. \\
        -size_samples: an integer specifying the size of the samples that are eventually extracted in the sample_training_data_tfrecord.py script. This is used to determine the correct amount of ghost cells. \\
        -precision: should be either 'double' or 'single'; specifies the required floating point precision for the calculations. \\
        -fourth_order: a boolean flag specifying the order of the interpolations. When False, second-order interpolation is used. When True, an error is thrown because fourth-order interpolation has not been implemented yet. \\
        -periodic_bc: a tuple existing of three booleans, which specifies for each coordinate direction (z,y,x) whether a periodic bc should be implemented. \\ 
        NOTE1: for the required ghost cells in the horizontal directions this is the only implemented way to include them. Consequently, setting the booleans equal to False in the horizontal directions will result in errors being thrown. \\
        NOTE2: no periodic bc has been implemented in the vertical direction. Consequently, setting the boolean in the vertical direction equal to True will results in an error being thrown. \\
        -zero_w_topbottom: boolean specifying whether the vertical wind velocities is 0 at the bottom and top levels of the domain or not. Since this is currently the only implemented way to include ghost cells in the vertical direction, setting the boolean equal to False will result in an error being thrown. \\
        -name_output_file: string defining the name of the produced output file. \\
        -create_file: boolean specifying whether a new netCDF file should be created or an existing one should be read. \\
        -testing: boolean specifying whether for testing-purposes user-defined input variables and grids should be used. Furthermore, plots of the turbulent transport components are made to check whether the calculated transports are correct. \\
        -settings_filepath: string specifying the filepath of the *.ini file produced by MicroHH containing the settings of the simulations. \\
        -grid_filepath: string specifying the filepath of the *.grid file produced by MicroHH containing information about the simulation grid. \\

        #NOTE2: As a consequence of NOTE1, at len+1 iteration for any given coordinate, only weights have to be known at the grid centers for other two coordinates: only part of the total transport terms need to be calculated (i.e. the terms located on the grid side boundaries for the coordinate in the len+1 iteration). This is ensured by additonal if-statements that evaluate to False at the len+1 iteration.
